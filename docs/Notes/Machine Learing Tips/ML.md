# 1 Introduction

## What is ML?

> Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that is concerned with building algorithms which, to be useful, rely on a collection of examples of some phenomenon. These examples can come from nature, be handcrafted by humans or generated by another algorithm.

## Types of ML

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Semi-supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

## Why the Model Works on New Data




## SVM

What is Support Vectors?

- They are the data points that lie **closest** to the hyperplane, or decision boundary, between the two classes.
- They are the data points **most difficult** to classify.
- They **directly** influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane.
