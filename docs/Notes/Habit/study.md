## **Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart**（[YouTube](https://youtu.be/IlU-zDU6aQ0)）

1. **Don't study for too long** if you are not enjoying it. Take short breaks after 20-30 minutes.
2. **Reward system**
3. **Dedicated study area** (Behavior Reinforcement).Don't study in the living room, bedroom, etc. Study in a separate place dedicated to studying. Special desk/ room for studying/working
4. **Rote memorization vs. Active learning**. Don't try to memorize without understanding. Try to understand the concept first. (be able to explain things in your own words)
5. **Don't always study alone.** Studying in groups helps a lot.
6. **Don't highlight text blindly.** Highlighting doesn't help that much. It only indicates Recognization not Recollection of the topic. (Recognition vs. Recollection)
7. **Sleep is so important** for pushing something into your long-term memory. Get at least 7-8 hours of sound sleep. (REM  Sleep)
8. **Always take notes.** Reviewing the notes after a short time helps a lot.
9. **Active Recitation**, Always try to teach others what you have learned. Teaching is the best way of learning.
10. **Study from books, Use the SQ3R**(survey, question, recite, read, review) method while studying. 20% reading 80% reciting
11. **Use Mnemonics**. It's the best way to memorize facts. (Acronyms, Coin Sayings, Interactive Images)

## **My Biggest Studying Mistake - The Feynman Technique**（[YouTube](https://youtu.be/IDB_3S1ezsc)）

**Feynman Technique:** try to explain a complicated topic in a simple way -> better understand

### **What is Feynman Technique?**

1. Identify the Information
2. How would you teach it( to a 12-year-old children)?
3. How does it sound?(simple? Use a lot of complex terms?Can redo explanation so that it is simpler and easier to understand?)

### **How to implement it?**

1. Understand the Topic

    Solidify information that you already understand(don't get wrong understanding solidified in your brain).

2. Long-term Retention

   Consolidate information that you took a lot of time to learn onto a flashcard so that you can remember it in the long term.

3. Notes on Notes Don't Work

    Ineffient.

4. Choose Topics Carefully

    Topics that are suitable to use Feynman Techique are **big general** pieces of information

5. Be non-ass

    Don't cheat. Take time and do it properly.

6. Avoid Complexity

    The more simply  you explain, the better you understand

7. Use it for Real

   Try to teaching this topic in real life.

8. Simplify Simplify Simplify

    **Most important tip**

    Redo simplification over and over.
