# **[Ph.D. Advising Statement](https://favonia.org/advising.html) by Favonia**

## **What is Advising**

1. Evaluate students as a supervisor and guide students as a mentor.
2. Interact on an equal term, long-term impact on academic life.
3. An expert in certain area and a person you feel comfortable to work with.

## **Skills to Cultivate**

1. **Mental Resilience**

    Most critical and the key to a satisfying academic experience. **Ph.D. = mental marathon**.

    1) **Check your future work environment.** Future advisor and other people in the group -> good support network. Knowing your advisor as a person is as essential as knowing their research;
    2) **How to react to events.** 
       1) Breathe.
       2) Observe emotions. Emotions are not bad they just exist.
       3) Be patient and kind to yourself. Learning takes time. Practice takes time. It is part of the process to make mistakes and learn from them. Be kind to yourself.
2. **Academic skills**
   1. **Technical/mathematical skills**
   2. **Presentation skills** pull the audience and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio
   3. **Social skills**

   Skills >> Records.

   You need to practise. A LOT.

   We will adjust our plan as we go.

3. **Communication**

   > It is not recommended to skip a meeting only because you feel you have made no progress. In fact, you probably need my advice most when you are stuck.


4. **TA**

    > Being a teaching assistant for a few courses will sharpen your teaching skills and prepare yourself for many faculty jobs. The downside is that a teaching assistantship will eat up your time, just like any other activity. In the desperate cases where my research funding is running out, you might have to be a teaching assistant. Other than the funding crisis, it should be your decision.

5. **Paper draft deadline**

    > finish first draft at least ten days before the deadline, it would take several rounds to revise the draft.
